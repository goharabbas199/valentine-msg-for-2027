- style.css
- script.js

No external frameworks.
Clean, professional code.
Responsive design.

THEME STRUCTURE
----------------------------------

1) INTRO SCREEN (Short Hacker Style Only At Beginning)

Full screen black background.

Typing animation that displays:

⚠ Unauthorized access detected...
Connecting to Mun's device...
Source identified: Year 2075
Secure romantic transmission incoming...

After typing finishes, smoothly fade transition into the romantic theme.

----------------------------------

2) ROMANTIC RED THEME (After Intro)

Switch completely to an elegant romantic deep red gradient background:
#2b0a12 to #5a0f1f

Use soft glowing red accents:
#ff0033
#ff4d6d

Modern clean typography.
No card design.
No floating hearts.
No childish design.

Smooth fade transitions between sections.

----------------------------------

3) VIDEO SECTION

Full screen video.
Autoplay.
object-fit: cover.
Covers entire screen.

----------------------------------

4) VALENTINE QUESTION SECTION

Centered content.
Large glowing text:

Will You Be My Valentine?

Subtext:
And promise to love even the old, wrinkly version of me?

Two buttons:

YES ❤️
- Neon red glowing button
- Smooth hover scale animation
- Soft glow effect

NO 😌
- Subtle outlined red
- Soft hover animation

----------------------------------

5) NO BUTTON LOGIC (IMPORTANT)

Do NOT auto redirect to YES.

When NO is clicked:
Stay on same screen and show playful messages.
Each time NO is clicked, show a different message.

First NO click:
Display:
"Hmm… that answer seems incorrect."
"Please reconsider carefully."

Show buttons:
YES ❤️
NO 😌

Second NO click:
Display:
"System Warning: That future version of me looks pretty good with white hair."
"Are you sure you want to lose that?"

Show buttons:
YES ❤️
NO 😌

Third NO click:
Display:
"Critical Alert: This love story strongly prefers YES."
"And honestly… don’t I look hot with white hair?"

Remove the NO button completely.
Only show:
YES ❤️

Do NOT auto transition.
Wait for user to click YES.

All transitions must be smooth fade animations.
Messages should appear centered with slight red glow.

----------------------------------

6) YES BUTTON LOGIC

When YES is clicked:
Fade to final screen:

Future Secured ❤️
Present version extremely happy.

Soft glow animation on text.
Romantic red background remains.
